\f0\fs24 \cf0 In R folder there is a file \'93geo_reply.csv\'94 that contains the geocoding information from running geocode() from the ggmap package. This file was saved because the process is time consuming.  \
\
If the code is not compiling because this file is not present, to recompile you can simply use set ling_data to the ling_data_orig omitting the observations with missing values.  }
