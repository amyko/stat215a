Feel free to decide the sections for your self.

The things you need to do are:

- compare C++ and R versions of the similarity matrix

- make the plot for part 3

- discuss how many clusters to choose

- discuss whether you trust the method or not


Take extra care on your code for this lab. A significant portion of the grade will be on your code!
